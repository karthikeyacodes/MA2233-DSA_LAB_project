# MA 2233 Data Structures and Applications Lab - Team Project: Substring Matching with finite automata and KMP Algorithm

## Project Description

This project focuses on substring matching, which involves determining if a given pattern (a word `w`) is present in a given stream of symbols (a sentence `s`). The project also explores related problems like spread subsequence matching and finding the longest common subsequence (LCS) between two sentences.

### Objectives
1. Implement the basic substring matching algorithm with a finite automaton.
2. Comment on the utility of this finite automaton approach for both the spread subsequence matching and the LCS problem.

## Setup Instructions

To set up and run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/karthikeyacodes/MA2233-DSA_LAB_project.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. For this project, you might need G++ Compiler and text editor to look into the codes.
